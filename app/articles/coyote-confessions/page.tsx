            In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, few have experienced the extreme highs and lows quite like Wile E.
            Crypto. A pseudonymous trader who's been in the space since 2013, Wile has seen it all—bull runs, bear
            markets, rug pulls, and life-changing gains. We sat down with this veteran to discuss the lessons learned
            from a decade of mistakes and triumphs.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <span className="font-bold text-amber-700">Wile E. Crypto:</span> Pure greed, if I'm being honest. I heard
              about Bitcoin hitting $100 and thought I'd missed the boat. Then I found all these altcoins promising to
              be "the next Bitcoin." I was like a kid in a candy store, buying anything with a cool logo and a promise.
              Classic rookie mistake.

              from ACME to catch a roadrunner. I lost about 80% of my initial investment on coins that don't even exist

              crypto journey?
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              <span className="font-bold text-amber-700">Wile E. Crypto:</span> 100x leverage during the 2021 bull run.
              I turned $10,000 into $300,000 in two weeks. I was a genius! Then I turned $300,000 into $0 in about 45
              minutes when the market corrected. That's the thing about leverage—it's like strapping yourself to a
              rocket. Great when it's going up, catastrophic when it changes direction.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <span className="font-bold text-gray-700">Play Buni:</span> How did you recover from that?

            <p>
              <span className="font-bold text-amber-700">Wile E. Crypto:</span> Mentally or financially? Mentally, it
              took months. Financially, I went back to basics. DCA into blue chips, staking for passive income, and
              building slowly. No more get-rich-quick schemes. The tortoise beats the hare in crypto, despite what
              TikTok influencers tell you.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <span className="font-bold text-amber-700">Wile E. Crypto:</span> I found Solana in early 2021 when I was
              looking for alternatives to Ethereum's gas fees. What kept me was the community and the developer
              ecosystem. It wasn't just about price action—it was about building something useful.

              rewarding, both financially and personally.

              "If I could tell newcomers one thing, it's this: the road is long, and you will make mistakes. That's
              inevitable. But learn from them instead of repeating them. And remember that community matters more than
              quick gains. Find projects you believe in, contribute where you can, and think in years, not days. Oh, and
              never, ever use max leverage—that cliff is deeper than it looks."
